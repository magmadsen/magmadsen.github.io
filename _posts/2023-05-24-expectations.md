# Introduction and expectations to the fast.ai course 

## Introduction

Starting on with the fast.ai course is exciting. Deep learning is a fascinating field and it is great to get the opportunity to get some hands on experience in th field. With the fast.ai course introduced in the Image Processing and Computer Vision course by Brian Lovell I'm now ready to explore the opportunities of A.I. in images with an easy to approach library. 

## Expectations
### 1. Practical Experience

The nice thing about fast.ai is that it offers hands-on opprotunities to learn A.I. I expect that I will get to implement and apply multiple algorithms from the start of the course and learn the theory behind them. Hopefully, I will get to know how to implement deep learning techniques in practice and gain a thorough understanding of how they work.

### 2. Progressive Learning

Another aspect of the fast.ai course is that it offeres progressive learning through each lesson. In this way I get to build on the previous modules and expand my skill set and knowledge throughout the course. 

### 3. Connecting with others

By creating this blog I also hope that I can share my fast.ai experience with others and connect and discuss A.I. matters that I may find difficult or want to share my knowledge off. Additionally, I believe that the community working with fast.ai is supportive and I hope that I will be able to find help in case I get stuck or in doubt with a certain topic.

### 4. Real-World Impact

I hope that the course offers continous insight in how the topics are applicable in the real world. Both in image classification and natural language processing I hope to gain an insight in how these fields can be applied in real world problems, and hopefully alsp how they can help businesses improve their daily work. 

### 5. Up-to-date content

Most importantly I hope and expect that the content presented in the fast.ai course is up-to-date and offers the cutting edge news within artificial intelligence. This is especially important today where we see a rapid evolution within the field of artificial intelligence. 

### 6. Choosing parts to learn

Although it would be ideal to learn and go through all modules of the fast.ai course, this is simply not possible with the given timeframe. I therefore hope that I can go through the course in my own pace and select the parts that I find the most relevant. Hopefully, this won't leave me with a disconnected learning experience.

### 7. Challenges 

With no doubt I expect challenges in the experience of learning fast.ai and frustration might kick in. However, challenges are the greatest way to learn new things so I hope that I can overcome these with a persistence and continous effort throughout the course.

### Conclusion

I look forward to start my journey into the fast.ai universe!
