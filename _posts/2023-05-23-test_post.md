# First post - exploring the possibilities of a blog post

In this post I'll look into what options I have of formatting content nicely. This includes how to use tables, images etc. This can help make my future blog posts look more appealing.

## Using tables

A table can be a nice way of presenting certain data. In exercise two of the assignment 3 in Image Processing and Computer Vision we are asked to train a model to classify animal types. The result of such a model's performance on the validation test could be presented in the following way in markdown format.
| Class    | Accuracy |
|---------|-----|
| Elephant    | 0.99  |
| Tiger    | 0.97  |
| Koala | 0.95  |

Allignment and other things could easily be custtomized to suit my needs.

## Images

A crucial part of a blog post is to be able to include images. The following image shows a sample of the images used in exercise to when training a model to classify animals.

Another way to show an image is in round format. This can be good for showing portraits of people. 

<img src="/images/Magnus.jpg" alt="Image of Magnus" style="clip-path: circle(50%); width: 200px;">

This is the function that I have utilized on the front page of my blog. And it just looks so nice!

## Footnotes

Footnotes are necessary for providing references in my blog posts. They can be added in the following way. Here is a footnote that refers to my own blog [^1].

## Code

Code snippets can be good when explaining how I have implemented certain things in my future projects. They can be included in the following way, where it is also possible to choose the programming language such that keywords etc. are highlighted.

```python
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate, loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat())
```
This code snippet shows how I fit the pretrained resnet18 model to my input DataBlock in exercise 2 of my assignment.

## Equations

Mathematical equations can be included using LaTeX syntax. Very simply this is how to add two numbers and subtract 1:

$2+2-1 = 3$

There is no limit for how complex the equations included in the markdown format can get.


## Conclusion

As seen from the above markdown offers a wide variety of options for customizing the layout of my blog posts. I'm certain that even more options exist and I might explore some of them in my coming posts.
