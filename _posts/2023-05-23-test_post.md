# First post - exploring the possibilities of a blog post


In this post I'll look into what options I have of formatting content nicely. This includes how to use tables, images etc. This can help make my future blog posts look more appealing.

## Using tables

A table can be a nice way of presenting certain data. In exercise two of the assignment 3 in Image Processing and Computer Vision we are asked to train a model to classify animal types. The result of such a model's performance on the validation test could be presented in the following way in markdown format.
| Class    | Accuracy |
|---------|-----|
| Elephant    | 0.99  |
| Tiger    | 0.97  |
| Koala | 0.95  |

Allignment and other things could easily be custtomized to suit my needs.

## Images

Including images in your blog posts can make them visually appealing. Here's how you can add an image using Markdown syntax:

![Image Description](image-url.png)

Make sure to replace `image-url.png` with the actual URL or file path of your image. You can also adjust the image size and add alternative text for accessibility.

## Footnotes

Footnotes provide additional information or references without interrupting the flow of your content. Markdown supports footnotes with a simple syntax:

Here is some text[^1]. And here is more text[^2].

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote.

You can place the footnote definitions anywhere in your document, and the footnotes will be automatically numbered and linked to their respective references.

## Code Blocks

To include code snippets or highlight specific lines of code, use code blocks in Markdown. Here's an example of a code block in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

You can specify the programming language for syntax highlighting, making your code easier to read and understand.

## Mathematical Equations

If your blog post involves mathematical content, Markdown allows you to include mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax. Here's an example:

The quadratic formula is defined as:

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

This way, you can express complex mathematical concepts in a readable and elegant manner.


## Conclusion

Markdown offers a wide range of graphical elements that you can utilize to enhance your blog posts. From tables and images to footnotes and mathematical equations, Markdown allows you to create visually appealing and informative content easily.

Experiment with these features and have fun exploring the possibilities!
